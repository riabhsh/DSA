//Bubble Sort(aka. Sinking Sort, Exchange Sort and also Stable Sorting Algo, in place Sorting Algo) Notes

=What are we Doing?
-with the first pass largest element came to the end.
-with the second pass second largest element came second from last end.
- repeats until all element gets sorted.

=Why are we Doing?
-in every pass(steps/epochs) largest element came to an end.
that's the idea behind bubble sort...
-its basically a Comparison Sort Method.
-every sorting algo is sorts step by step.

=Space and Time Complexity
-Space Complexity: O(1)
constant // no extra space required i.e. copying the array is not required.
aka in place sorting algorithms

-Time Complexities:
Best Case: O(N) => sorted
Worst Case: O(N^2) => sorted in descending order.
(N = number of comparisons.)

-as the size of array is growing,
the number of comparisons is also growing

=Stable Sorting Algo
it is also called Stable Sorting Algorithm,
order should be the same when the value is same.
