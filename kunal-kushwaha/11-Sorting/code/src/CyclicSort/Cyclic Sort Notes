//Cyclic Sort Notes

=What are we Doing?
- CHECK, SWAP, MOVE.
-we use only one loop.

=Why are we Doing?
-when given numbers in range 1 to N(like continuous range it can be 0 to N-1) use Cyclic Sort
eg: find missing, find smallest missing, find duplicate etc where numbers from 1 to N.

=Space and Time Complexity
-Space Complexity: O(1)
constant // no extra space required i.e. copying the array is not required.
aka in place sorting algorithms

-Time Complexities:
Best Case: O(N) => sorted
Worst Case: O(N^2) => sorted in descending order.
(N = number of comparisons.)

-as the size of array is growing,
the number of comparisons is also growing

=Stable Sorting Algo?
it is a Stable Sorting Algorithm,
order should be the same when the value is same.
