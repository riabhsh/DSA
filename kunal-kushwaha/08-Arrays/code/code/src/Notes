+++ ARRAY +++
1. Array is a Collection Similar type Of DataTypes.

//Syntax
        //Datatype[] variable_name = new datatype[size];

        int[] ros = new int[5];
        int[] ros = {23, 45, 45, 65, 45};

        int[] ros; //Declaration of an Array, ros is getting defined in a stack ... it happens at compile time.
        ros = new int[5]; //initialization: actually here object is being created in memory(heap)... it happens at run time


        int[] rishabh = new int[54];

        int[] //datatype
        rishabh //Reference Variable
        new int[54]; creating object in heap memory

2.
-Array Objects are in heap
-Array is may not be internally continuous in java because of jvm (DMA)
-heap is not continuous

3.
-new: new keyword is used to create an object in the heap memory
-Only Primitives are stored in Stack memory and all the other things are stored in heap memory.

-each element in a Array is an object which is stored in heap an some reference variable is pointing to them
-by default if reference variable has no value it value is NULL.

4. Array List
- When you dont know the array size (similar to vectors in c++)

import java.util.ArrayList;
//Syntax;
ArrayList<Integer> List_Name = new ArrayList<>(10) // here you can give any size i have give 10 for reference

System.out.print(List_Name);

List.Name.add(54);

there are many more functions like add in ArrayList(Part of Collection Framework)
